## Concepts and Goals

### 1. Able to control elements on each frame

### 2. Elm architecture

### 3. Vue-liked system

In this crate, core elements of the Elm architecture such as Model, View, Update, and Message are managed as components. Each component can pass messages to its child components within its update function. Events triggered by widgets within a component are first handled by that component, and the component can also emit events to its parent.

### 4. Minimum runtime error
